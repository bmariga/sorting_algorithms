# Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation

# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

# Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by iteratively inserting each element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.

# Selection Sort
Is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

# Quick Sort
QuickSort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It is known for its efficiency and typically outperforms other sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort, especially when * dealing with large datasets.

The basic idea behind QuickSort is to select a pivot element from the array and partition the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted using the same process until the entire array is sorted.
