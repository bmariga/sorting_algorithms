# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
